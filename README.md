## ComfyUI local image app

This repo now includes an additive, ComfyUI-based local image app under
`comfyui_app/` that replaces the Hugging Face **diffusers** WebUI for the
FLUX.2 [klein] 4B workflow. ComfyUI is faster and more VRAM-efficient on
8 GB cards, and the new app keeps the existing image-edit, video-frame, batch,
and text-to-image workflows.

### Model layout

- `models/diffusion_models/`
- `models/text_encoders/`
- `models/vae/`
  - Default: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-small-decoder` →
    `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors`
  - Fallback: `Comfy-Org/flux2-klein-4B` → `flux2-vae.safetensors`

The small decoder is the preferred VAE for this app. It is a distilled,
drop-in decoder that is about 1.4× faster to decode and uses about 1.4× less
VRAM than the standard `flux2-vae` decoder, with minimal quality difference.
For image edit and batch workflows we still use the standard VAE encode path;
the single-file `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors` is used because it
contains the normal encoder plus the faster decoder.

### RTX 3070 / 8 GB default plan

- Diffusion: `flux-2-klein-4b-fp8.safetensors`
- Text encoder: `qwen_3_4b_fp4_flux2.safetensors`
- VAE: `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors`
- Decode: `VAEDecodeTiled`

### Optional speedups

- **SageAttention 2** is preferred and is auto-used when available via
  `--use-sage-attention`.
- **Nunchaku INT4** is experimental but can be much faster. It uses the
  `svdq-int4_r32-FLUX.2-klein-4B-Nunchaku.safetensors` model from
  `tonera/FLUX.2-klein-4B-Nunchaku` and requires the optional Nunchaku
  install path. Run `python -m comfyui_app.installer --with-experimental-speedups`
  to try it, then choose it from the UI engine dropdown.
- **torch.compile** is available as a checkbox in the UI. It can speed up
  repeated runs after the first compile, but the first run is slower and
  resolution changes trigger recompilation.
top of ComfyUI's HTTP API behind a simple, non-technical Gradio front end — no
node graph required.

The original diffusers Gradio app (`app.py`, `src/`, `Install.bat`,
`Launch.bat`) is left **unchanged** so you can fall back to it at any time.

### Quick start (Windows)

1. `Install-ComfyUI.bat` — creates the venv, installs the CUDA PyTorch stack,
   clones ComfyUI + the `ComfyUI-GGUF` and `ComfyUI-Manager` custom nodes,
   prompts once for a **Hugging Face token**, auto-detects your VRAM, and
   downloads the correct FLUX.2 Klein 4B model files into the right folders.
2. `Launch-ComfyUI.bat` — starts the ComfyUI server (with the launch flags
   chosen for your GPU) and opens the simplified UI at http://127.0.0.1:7861.

The Hugging Face token is saved to `.env` (which is git-ignored). Some FLUX.2
repos are gated — accept the license on the model page (linked in error
messages) before running setup. Re-running setup with
`python -m comfyui_app.installer --refresh-models` re-checks the repos and pulls
the current recommended files.

### What you get in the UI

- **Image Edit** – upload an image + prompt/negative prompt; text-guided edit.
- **Video to Frames** – upload a video, extract every Nth frame, then run the
  same edit pipeline over every extracted frame.
- **Batch Folder** – point at an input folder; one shared prompt + negative
  prompt is applied to every image in it.
- **Text-to-Image** – native FLUX.2 Klein text-to-image (bonus).
- Every tab has an **Output folder** field so results save where you choose
  (default: `output/`).

### Model auto-install ("model resolver")

`comfyui_app/model_resolver.py` is a repeatable resolver rather than a set of
hard-coded links. For each component (diffusion model, text encoder, VAE) it
queries the Hugging Face API live
(`/api/models/<repo>/tree/main?recursive=1`) and picks the current file that
matches a stable filename pattern, so newer Klein 4B distilled checkpoints are
picked up automatically when you re-run setup. Repos checked:

- `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4b-fp8` – fp8 distilled diffusion model
- `unsloth/FLUX.2-klein-4B-GGUF` – GGUF quantized fallbacks (Q4_K_M / Q3 / Q2)
- `Comfy-Org/flux2-klein-4B` – fp4 & full text encoders, VAE
- `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` – reference (upstream distilled repo)

Files are downloaded with `huggingface_hub` (authenticated with your token),
flattened into `ComfyUI/models/{diffusion_models,text_encoders,vae}`, and
recorded in `resolved_models.json` (repo, remote path, size, sha) so unchanged
files are skipped on re-run. Gated/expired-token/unaccepted-license failures are
reported in plain language with the exact model page to visit.

For the VAE, the resolver **defaults to BFL's distilled small decoder**
(`black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-small-decoder`) and falls back to
`Comfy-Org/flux2-klein-4B`'s `flux2-vae.safetensors` only if that lookup fails.
See the VAE note below.

### RTX 3070 (8 GB) optimization — what was chosen and why

Detected VRAM selects a tier (`comfyui_app/vram.py`). On an RTX 3070 (8 GB) the
resolver lands in the **7–9 GB** tier:

| Setting | Choice for 8 GB | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diffusion model | `flux-2-klein-4b-fp8.safetensors` (~4.0 GB) | fp8 halves the weight footprint vs bf16 (~7.75 GB) so Klein fits in 8 GB with ComfyUI's smart offload. Note: the RTX 3070 (Ampere) has **no fp8 tensor cores** — fp8 is a VRAM win here, not a compute speedup (fp8 matmul acceleration starts at Ada/40-series). Because offloading is the main slowdown on 8 GB, a GGUF Q5/Q4 that stays fully resident can be *faster* end-to-end; see the GGUF fallback row. |
| Diffusion fallback | GGUF `Q4_K_M` (~2.6 GB), then `Q3`/`Q2` | If fp8 OOMs, the app automatically retries with a lighter GGUF quant via the `UnetLoaderGGUF` node (ComfyUI-GGUF). Q4_K_M keeps most quality at ~2.6 GB. |
| Text encoder | `qwen_3_4b_fp4_flux2.safetensors` (~3.85 GB) | The full Qwen3-4B encoder is ~8 GB and won't co-reside; the fp4 build is half the size. ComfyUI runs the encoder, frees it, then loads the diffusion model, so peak VRAM stays manageable. |
| VAE | `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors` (~0.25 GB) | BFL's distilled small decoder: ~1.4× faster decode and ~1.4× less VRAM than the standard `flux2-vae`, minimal quality loss. Full standard encoder is retained for the edit/video/batch encode path. `flux2-vae.safetensors` is the automatic fallback. |
| Decode | `VAEDecodeTiled` | Tiled decode caps peak VRAM during decode on 8 GB, preventing end-of-run OOM at higher resolutions. |
| Sampler / scheduler | `euler` + `Flux2Scheduler` | Matches the official distilled Klein template. |
| Steps | `4` | Distilled Klein is a 4-step model; more steps waste time without quality gains. |
| Guidance (CFG) | `1.0` | Distilled Klein uses CFG 1. See the negative-prompt note below. |
| Launch flags | `--fast fp16_accumulation --reserve-vram 0.8 --fast-disk`, `--use-sage-attention` (if installed) | `--fast` is scoped to `fp16_accumulation` (the feature that actually speeds up Ampere; bare `--fast` also enables `fp8_matrix_mult`, a no-op on the 3070 that can degrade quality). `--reserve-vram 0.8` leaves headroom for the Windows display to avoid OOM/offload stalls. `--fast-disk` speeds the unavoidable offload on NVMe SSDs (drop it if models live on an HDD). SageAttention gives a 2–5× INT8 attention speedup on Ampere. `--lowvram` is added only on the sub-7 GB tiers. |

### Notes / limitations

- **Small VAE decoder:** the app defaults to BFL's distilled
  `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-small-decoder`
  (`full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors`) — ~1.4× faster decode and ~1.4×
  less VRAM than the standard `flux2-vae` decoder, with minimal quality loss —
  combined with `VAEDecodeTiled` for the lowest peak VRAM on 8 GB.
  `flux2-vae.safetensors` is the automatic fallback if the small-decoder repo
  can't be resolved.
- **fp8 on the RTX 3070:** fp8 saves VRAM but does **not** accelerate compute on
  Ampere (no fp8 tensor cores). On 8 GB the dominant cost is weight offloading,
  so if you want more speed, try the GGUF path (Q5_K_M/Q4_K_M) which can keep the
  model fully resident and avoid offload.
- **Negative prompt on the distilled model:** the distilled Klein workflow runs
  at CFG 1.0, where the negative branch is mathematically ignored. The negative
  prompt field is still wired end-to-end (and shared across batch) so it takes
  effect if you raise Guidance above 1.0 — but the distilled model is not tuned
  for CFG > 1, so expect limited benefit. Leave Guidance at 1.0 for best speed.

### Changing models later

- Re-run `python -m comfyui_app.installer --refresh-models` to re-resolve and
  pull the current recommended files (picks up new releases automatically).
- To pin different files, edit `MODEL_REGISTRY` / the VRAM tiers in
  `comfyui_app/model_resolver.py` and `comfyui_app/vram.py` (repo + filename
  regex per component), then refresh.
- Delete `comfyui_app/resolved_models.json` (and the copy in `ComfyUI/`) to force
  a clean re-download.
